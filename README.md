## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project was built with a modern, robust, and scalable tech stack.

* **Framework:** React (with Vite)
* **UI Library:** Shadcn/ui & Tailwind CSS
* **State Management:** Redux Toolkit with `redux-persist` for local storage persistence.
* **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API via Vercel Serverless Functions.
* **Drag & Drop:** Native HTML Drag and Drop API for a lightweight and robust experience.
* **Deployment:** Vercel

### Key Architectural Decisions

* **Secure API Key Management:** All calls to the Gemini API are proxied through serverless functions running on Vercel. The secret API key is stored securely as an environment variable and is never exposed to the client-side, preventing unauthorized use.
* **Client-Side File Parsing:** To ensure maximum robustness and avoid server-side environment bugs (especially on Windows), resume files (`.pdf` and `.docx`) are parsed directly in the browser using `pdfjs-dist` and `mammoth.js`. Only the extracted text is sent to the backend, which is more efficient and reliable.
* **Centralized & Persistent State:** Redux Toolkit was chosen to manage the complex state of the interview and the list of candidates. `redux-persist` ensures a seamless user experience by saving all progress locally, allowing for features like session restoration.

* npm
* A Vercel account (for the Vercel CLI)

**Installation:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install the Vercel CLI:**
    ```sh
    npm install -g vercel
    ```

4.  **Set up your Environment Variables:**
    * Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project.
    * Add your Google Gemini API key to this file:
        ```env
        GEMINI_API_KEY=your_secret_api_key_here
        ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    * This project uses the Vercel CLI for local development to properly handle the serverless functions in the `/api` directory.
    ```sh
    vercel dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
